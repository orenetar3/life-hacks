# Some of my travel hacks

I travel a considerable amount every year and have developed various hacks to make my life easier. I figured I should document some of these so others may benefit.

### __Power__  
I usually tend to avoid power adapters since they fit in sockets very loosely and generally fall out (especially European sockets). Instead I prefer [Twelve South's PlugBug World](https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/plugbug-world). It allows me to swap out the connector on my Macbook Air (or Pro) charger for appropriate country. Additionally it comes with a USB port that charges phones and tablets much faster than the standard `5`v connector that Apple provides. Also, it saves the need for carrying around additional chargers.

### __Sleep hack__  
I generally avoid jet lag by hacking my sleep to a minor extent. The suggestions that follow are probably not appropriate for most people and would also make my doctor cringe. 

a) If you're landing before noon at your destination:
TLDR: Sleep much of the plane ride.  
Eat a giant meal at the airport.  
Hop on the plane, listen to some amazing ambient electronic music till cruising altitude. Then switch to movie (because by then the pilot will stop interrupting your movie). 
Then watch a movie, order some alcohol (please get something out of a tiny bottle, not the cheap vinegar they serve as wine) and pop an Ambien ™. 
Try to avoid eating on the plane as much as possible. 
Wake up at before landing, maybe have coffee, then eat a giant greasy breakfast asap. 

b) If landing at destination late afternoon to evening:  
There is no set recommendation here but don't sleep too much on the plane. 
Definitely nap for a couple of hours here and there but stay awake and watch as many bad movies as possible. Drink lightly, but not enough to put you to sleep.
Then eat a light (I mean light) dinner at destination and take an Ambien ™ and get to bed at 10pm or after. You'll comfortably wake up at 6 and have a great day.



### __Wifi__  

It's a god damned pain in the ass to connect your laptop, phone, tablet, kindle (I need to sync my place in books because I read on kindle and phone), other devices with a stupid new password or splash page. So get a router that all your devices already know. I strongly recommend NetGear Trek. Alternate choice is the Gi.net crap.

a) Plug ethernet cable into your router, plug router into wall. DONE
b) Plug router into wall. Connect router to wifi once. DONE.

### __Keeping your voice__  

If you're traveling, especially to a conference, you're going to be speaking to a lot of people. It's very easy to lose your voice on day 2. I've found Fisherman's Friend to be the best defense against that. You can buy a large box on Amazon for pretty cheap and leave little packs all over your carry on and day packs. These are strong and take a long time to melt and keep your throat well coated.
